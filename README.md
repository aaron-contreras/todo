# Todo âœ…

A Rails version of the classic Todo app.

Although this is quite a common project throughout the community, I'm using it as special practice to focus on an architecture concept picked up from a Robert C. Martin talk.

1. Use-case driven approach to application architecture.

Taking advantage of this being a Rails 7 project, I'm using this as a means to get familiar with the new Rails 7 ecosystem (mostly importmaps).

This project uses Ruby (3.0.2).

To run this project locally:

1. Run `bundle install`
2. Run `bin/rails s --binding=0.0.0.0`
